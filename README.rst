Systems
=======

Main sources for this project are Quantopia and blockchain (Ethereum & Ripple). Both technologies are linked to financial services.
The main motivation to use these platforms is available live data. 

There is certain appeal to defining the system based on physical phenomena. However, finding practicality as an output is likely problematic.  
Instead, defining a system with publicly available and authentic data as input is lot more appealing 

The main language used in this project is Python. Links related:
